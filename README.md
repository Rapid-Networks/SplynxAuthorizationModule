## About

> Wow, I am really getting tired of trying to implement the authentication for Splynx everytime I start a new project.

This is a microservice container built for ongoing projects involving our (at time of writing) ISP billing software: [Splynx][Splynx home].
This service uses the [v2][Splynx API Doc] API spec for communicating with the Splynx API

## Building :nut_and_bolt:

### Ready the environment:

1. Create a file in the root directory named `environment.json`, and add all the environment variables as required in the environment.ts [schema][Convict schema].

## Production :briefcase:

In production mode, the service will load the environment variables from the container directory `./opt/sam/config/environment.json` and will throw an `INITIALIZATION_ERROR` should the config not be present.[^production_env]

The service will pipe all logs to a compressed file found in `./opt/sam/logs`. Hitting the `/logs` endpoint will return the full log stream for further processing.

## Development :desktop_computer:

In development mode, the service will load the environment variables in the current development directory, in `./config/{environment}.json` and will throw an `INITIALIZATION_ERROR` should the config not be present or not named after the environment it is loaded in.

### Database

In development the service assumes a redis stack docker container is running on its default mappings. This allows you to view the database with your browser of choice with redInsight on `http://localhost:8001`.

#### _Quickstart:_

```
docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
```

> You can read more on their official documentation [here][Redis-stack docker install]

[^production_env]: This directory should be present within the docker image.
