## About

> Wow, I am really getting tired of trying to implement the authentication for Splynx everytime I start a new project.

This module is built for ongoing projects involving our (at time of writing) ISP billing software: [Splynx][Splynx home].
This service uses the [v2][Splynx API Doc] API spec for communicating with the Splynx API.

## Usage :rocket:

Still in development

[Splynx home]: https://splynx.com/
